    <p>Hi everyone! I'm 34 years old and restarting my collegiate journey with the hopes of using this
        program to jumstart a new career! I live in Scottsburg, IN (USA) with my wife Nikki and our 4
        kiddos. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for just over
        3 years - yes that right, I got baptized during Covid lockdowns and boy was it an experience!
    </p>
    <p>Our family loves to travel and one of our favorite ways to vacation is by cruising (My picture is
        me on the MSC Seaside just off the coast of Miami back in 2016). We are looking forward to our
        next adventure later this year after a loooonnnnggg break becasuse of the health restrictions. 
    </p>
    <p>This Spring semester will be my first time back to school in a while, so while I'm excited, I am
        also a little bit nervous. But I can't wait to go through this course with all of your and learn
        new and exciting things about web development! I can't wait to see all of your stories too!
    </p>
